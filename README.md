Cybersecurity career path, all the information!

What you'll see in this portfolio are all the projects I made while preparing myself for a CyberSecurity career. It is quite a journey considering I come from a banking-sales background and had little to no IT technical knowledge. Hope you enjoy my portfolio as much as I did while working on it.

The projects seen in this repository are all the opportunities developed throughout the certificate program - Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. The skills you'll be able to detect in some of the projects include SIEM tools, programming, security ethics and many others related to those needed by any aspiring for the role of a CyberSecurity professional. 

--??Modeling and Evaluation: Name and describe the models you used for the project and any corresponding evaluation metrics. 

Each organization have their own set of tools, playbooks and security controls, but with this portfolio I can show you that even if my previous experience doesn't allign with those of your organization, I have the will and capacity to learn and adapt to do the job that I am applying for.
